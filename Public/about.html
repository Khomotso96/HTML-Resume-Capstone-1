<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a passionate and creative software developer with a deep interest in technology, particularly in mobile and web development. I thrive on building solutions that are not only functional but also user-friendly and impactful. I have always enjoyed solving problems and pushing boundaries in the tech world, which has driven me to develop full-stack applications and delve into native mobile development using frameworks like Jetpack Compose.
  What excites me about technology is its ability to transform lives and connect people, which aligns with my dream of creating meaningful applications, whether it is a social media platform or a medical appointment system. I believe in continuous learning and improvement, and I have honed my skills through rigorous training, like my software engineering bootcamp where I excelled with a 100% average, and real-world projects that allowed me to explore creative and technical possibilities.
  I aspire to become a web developer because it offers me the perfect balance of creativity and technical problem-solving. I want to build intuitive, accessible, and aesthetically pleasing applications that leave a lasting impact on users. My goal is to contribute to projects that make a difference while growing in my craft as a developer.</p>
